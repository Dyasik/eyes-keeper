# Eyes Keeper
#### An utility which helps you to keep your eyesight
Just add this to your StartUp and it will remind you about giving your eyes a rest every hour!

You may set your own delay time (default - 1 hour) by pressing a "cog" icon when the window shows up, or you may set it or turn the program off any time by pressing the icon in tray with RMB.

### Warning! If you have an active full-screen application (e.g. you are playing DOTA2) it will be minimized when the EyesKeeper shows up!
So make sure you close EyeKeeper before you play some competitive matchmaking (though I think it won't really disturb you in singleplayer/non-competitive games).
